This is a remake of a classical game with all the stuf that I wanted to have it in the same game.  

# Game logic

## Map
Map size is 72x48.  Latitud determines the relation to the equator, increasing towards south, and longitud are the meridians increasing towards east.  Zero, Zero, is the center of the scren.  But, the map can be shifted sideways on the screen, moving the zero,zero position. The northern and sourthern part of the map work like in a Oblate Spheroid, so going north from longitud L at the top, means coming from the north at longitud -L, symmetric in relation to the zero meridian.  Of course when there is possible to move according to the unit.  This can change sea warfare.
