This is a remake of a classical game with all the stuf that I wanted to have it in the same game.  

# Game logic

Map size is 70x40.  The map can be shifted sideways on the screen. The northern and sourthern part of the map work like in a sphere, so going north at the top, means coming from the north and the unit will move around the 0 longitude.
